# Stock-price-and-news-email
This is an app for sending e-mail with the price movement and relevant news of a stock. The price is tracked using an API request from the website https://www.alphavantage.co/, while the news are extracted from the website https://newsapi.org/ again using an API request. The e-mail is sent using the smtplib library of Python, while the GUI has been created with the tkinter module. The user has to provide through the GUI his/hers e-mail address, app password and the keys for the APIs.
